Does it enhance positive social values, or does it support a range of negative or contradictory values?

Children learn various values, beliefs, ideas, and skills. In this context, opinions about electronic social networks vary. One perspective sees these platforms as an opportunity for humanity to exchange communication and knowledge, transcending time and space, thereby contributing to human closeness and interaction, and forming new social relationships. Another perspective views social media as a threat to social relationships, intersecting with societal traditions and values, leading to isolation and the disintegration of the family and social fabric, as it invades family life and reduces opportunities for interaction and communication among its members (Bouchleby, 2006",
